# Profile Application -- Hours taken for completion = < 8

A mobile application that appears to have the functionality of a profile page.

- During development I ran this on windows and android using expo .

- Capabilities: upload and edit name, number, email, and bio.
  note: User is also able to select a photo to update their page with.
  However the program does not successfully update the home page's avatar.
